            Formed in the static of early 2000s Brooklyn—dial-up heard through screen-flickered windows, busted Casios, and the afterglow of a fading DIY scene—<strong>don’t go dull</strong> is memory glitching in real time. Sound wedged in the space between archive and dissonance: lush pads dissolve into blown-out drums, autotuned murmurs warp into digital shrieks and soft melodies with frayed seams. Equal parts overheard and deeply internal, shaped by internet wormholes, a voyeuristic glare into the soul of chain store brain rot, and the eerie pulse of obsolete tech. What emerges is unformed, cinematic, and shape shifting—a mind map etched by vapor trails and digital noise.
